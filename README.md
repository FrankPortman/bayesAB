## Fast Bayesian Methods for AB Testing

bayesAB provides a suite of functions that allow the user to analyze A/B test
data in a Bayesian framework. bayesAB is intended to be a drop-in replacement for
common frequentist hypothesis test such as the t-test and chi-sq test.

Bayesian methods provide several benefits over frequentist methods in the context of
A/B tests - namely in interpretability. Instead of p-values you get direct
probabilities on whether A is better than B (and by how much). Instead of point estimates
your posterior distributions are parametrized random variables which can be summarized
any number of ways. 

While Bayesian AB tests are still not immune to peeking in the broadest
sense, you can use the 'Posterior Expected Loss' provided in the package to draw conclusions
at any point with respect to your threshold for error.

The general bayesAB workflow is as follows:

- Decide how you want to parametrize your data (Poisson for counts of email submissions, Bernoulli for CTR on an ad, etc.)
- Use our helper functions to decide on priors for your data (`?bayesTest`, `?plotDistributions`)
- Fit a `bayesTest` object
  - Optional: Use `combine` to munge together several `bayesTest` objects together for an arbitrary / non-analytical target distribution
- `print`, `plot`, and `summary` to interpret your results
  - Determine whether to stop your test early given the Posterior Expected Loss in `summary` output

Optionally, use `banditize` and/or `deployBandit` to turn a pre-calculated (or empty) `bayesTest` into a multi-armed bandit that can serve recipe recommendations and adapt as new data comes in.

Note, while bayesAB was designed to exploit data related to A/B/etc tests, you can use the package to conduct Bayesian analysis on virtually any vector of data, as long as it can be parametrized by the available functions.

For a more in-depth look please check the package vignettes with `browseVignettes(package = "bayesAB")` or the pre-knit HTML version on CRAN [here](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bayesAB/vignettes/introduction.html). Brief example below. Run the following code for a quick overview of bayesAB:

``` r
library(bayesAB)

# Choose bernoulli test priors
plotBeta(2, 3)

```

``` r
A_binom <- rbinom(100, 1, .5)
B_binom <- rbinom(100, 1, .55)

# Fit bernoulli test
AB1 <- bayesTest(A_binom,
                 B_binom,
                 priors = c('alpha' = 1, 'beta' = 1),
                 distribution = 'bernoulli')

plot(AB1)

```
